1. Our project will be divided into three parts in perspectives of users: sign up, sign in, and play a web game. Each of part should have at least one html page. Sign-up will write user-preferred account and password into a database file. Sign-in will verify account name and password from user input to see whether they have been stored in database. If yse, then the web game page pops up; otherwise the user will be notified that account name or password is incorrect. We decide to manually test. That is, we pretend to be users and go through every step; then we will check database file to see if it is properly read and written. Of course, we will use amazon ec2 instance as our server. Our project is simply for practice on web app management and deployment. Because the game was written in java applet by my team in CIS 422 course, it works locally fine but definitely has some problems to solve when we try to put it online.

2. User population will be students who currently enrolled in CIS 399 and some of friends and my parents becuase I want to somewhat show off to them :) Right now there is one obvious user support issue. Because the game does not have built-in reset function, users may be able to reset it only by reloading the file. We will add "find lost password" function to our project if we have time.

3. As for security issues, we will concern about database file that stores user information. We will minimize the security risk by manipulating file permission, encryption of user information, and putting the database on server.

4. Most of work will be deployment of the game and setting up sign-in and sign-up pages (with database involved) for users. From my initial research, I found that most browsers do not like java in terms of browser and system setting. Sometime java is disabled by default. We will write how to enable java in user manual. 
5. Not applicable for now..
