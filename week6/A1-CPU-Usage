Here is the email I received from Amazon after running the command yes | awk '{ print "hello" }'
and letting the console print hello for a little while.

You are receiving this email because your Amazon CloudWatch Alarm "A1-High-CPU-Utilization" in the US West - Oregon region has entered the ALARM state, because "Threshold Crossed: 1 datapoint (74.138) was greater than the threshold (20.0)." at "Saturday 30 July, 2016 21:41:44 UTC".
